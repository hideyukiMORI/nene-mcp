# Field Trial 163 — Misconfiguration adversarial

Automated individual report per [`quality-strategy.md`](quality-strategy.md).

## Date

2026-05-22

## Baseline

- nene-mcp ref: `0.1.3`
- Runner: `tools/ft-individual.sh 163`
- Catalog: `/home/xi/docker/nene-mcp-FT/ft5-nene-multi-read/docs/mcp/tools.json` (when HTTP suites run)
- MCP client: stdio harness

## Goal

Regression + adversarial probe: **Misconfiguration adversarial**.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Primary suite

```text
# FT163 misconfig probe
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"error":{"code":-32603,"message":"MCP tool catalog could not be read from \"/nonexistent/tools.json\"."}}
PASS invalid catalog path fails loud
```

## MCP Verification Results

| Scenario | Expectation | Actual | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Automated suite | PASS lines, no FAIL | See log above | Pass |
| Security cadence (N % 3 == 0) | write-failclosed pass | N/A | N/A |

## Friction Summary

None this cycle.

## Recommendations

None.

## Security Review (required when N % 3 == 0)

N/A — security review scheduled for FT165.

## Follow-up Issues

None.

## Overall Impression

Automated FT163 (Misconfiguration adversarial): **Pass**.

## Next FT gate

- [ ] No open actionable Issues before FT164
